Harvard Art Museum Art Randomizer

Visit the deployed Vue.js [HAM Art Randomizer](https://vue-harvard-art.herokuapp.com/) application.

## Developer Setup

 - Clone down the repository and cd into the project directory. 
 - Run `npm i` to install the application dependencies.
 - From the command line the following commands are useful:
    - Hot-reloads for development: `npm run serve`
    - Compile and minify for prod: `npm run build`
    - Lint and fix files: `npm run lint`

## Description 

HAM Art Randomizer is a Vue.js application built as a take home challenge to demonstrate implementing a framework I had previously never worked in. The application works with the [Harvard Art Museum API](https://github.com/harvardartmuseums/api-docs) serving up a random collection of Harvard Art Museum videos, images, audio pieces, colors, etc. The application was build as an individual project over the course of four days. Given that I had never previously worked with Vue, and most of my experience with JS frameworks is with React, it was great to get a feel for developing with Vue. I am eager to continue working with the framework into the future.
